<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to import a project from the GitHub repository  and set it up. After the initial setup, the user has requested a series of feature additions and modifications to build out a website for Inseminar de Colombia, a cattle genetics company.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS**:
1.  Import and set up the provided GitHub project.
2.  Create categories for different bull breeds and add specific bulls to each, extracting data from user-provided screenshots and images.
3.  Implement a hero section, update the header, and add thematic backgrounds.
4.  Continuously modify bull data, including adding/removing bulls, updating photos, and changing page layouts based on iterative user feedback.
5.  Refactor hardcoded data and configurations to improve maintainability.
6.  Create new pages and components to accommodate new categories and specific bull designs.
7.  Add detailed information sections, such as pedigree charts (as text and later as images), to bull detail pages.
8.  Modify the display of pedigree information, changing from a dedicated section to a secondary image in a thumbnail gallery.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
The project is a static Next.js application for a cattle genetics company. While it started with all data hardcoded in a single component, it has evolved.

Key features and structure:
*   A homepage () with a hero slider, partner logos, and main category cards.
*   Breed category pages. The  is the most advanced, displaying a 3-column grid of bulls. Other breed pages (, etc.) still exist in their original format.
*   A highly refactored data structure for the GYR breed. Data is now separated into .
*   A reusable detail page component for GYR bulls: . This component supports a main image with a thumbnail gallery for secondary images (like pedigrees).
*   A custom, unique detail page for the bull EDANK: .
*   An environment file  for the WhatsApp contact number.
*   A  directory containing all professional photos for bulls and pedigree images.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: The user requested to add a new bull, NEMO DAY, to a new category, GIROLANDO 3/4. The agent analyzed the user-provided screenshot to extract the bull's data and was about to begin creating the new category page and data files.
*   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done**: N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: Create the GIROLANDO 3/4 category and add the bull NEMO DAY. (Priority: P0)

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1**:
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent successfully analyzed the user-provided screenshot to get the data for NEMO DAY. No files have been created yet.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Create a new page component, , by duplicating and adapting .
        2.  Create a new data file, , to store the data for NEMO DAY and future bulls in this category. Follow the structure of .
        3.  Create a reusable detail page component  or adapt  to be more generic.
        4.  Update the main navigation in  to include a link to the new GIROLANDO 3/4 category.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To fulfill the user's latest request to expand the website with a new bull and a new breed category.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Create the GIROLANDO 3/4 category. (Priority: P0)
    -   **Where to resume**: Start by creating the necessary files (, ). The agent had just finished analyzing the bull's data.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A new bull breed category will be added to the website, expanding the company's catalog.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Future Tasks**:
    *   **Refactor other breed categories (P2)**: Apply the data separation pattern (used for GYR) to the other existing breeds (Holstein, Jersey, etc.) whose data is still hardcoded in . This involves creating new data files and view components for each.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **UI Cleanup (EDANK)**: Hid irrelevant sections on the EDANK bull page as requested.
-   **Refactor WhatsApp URL**: Moved the hardcoded WhatsApp number to a  variable in a new  file.
-   **GYR Category Refactor & Build-out**:
    -   Separated all GYR bull data into a dedicated  file.
    -   Created a reusable detail page at .
    -   Created a unique, custom-designed page for the bull EDANK at .
    -   Added a total of 14 bulls to the GYR category.
    -   Updated the  layout to display bulls in a 3-column grid.
-   **Feature: Image Thumbnails**: Modified the bull detail page to support a main image with a gallery of clickable thumbnails, allowing users to switch between a bull's photo and its pedigree image.
-   **Data Management (Pedigrees)**:
    -   Initially added a text-based pedigree section to several bulls.
    -   Replaced the text section with a pedigree image displayed below the data tables.
    -   Iteratively corrected numerous mismatched pedigree images.
    -   Finally, removed the pedigree image section and added the pedigree image as a second thumbnail in the main image gallery for several bulls, as requested by the user.
-   **Data Management (Photos)**: Updated profile photos for nearly all GYR bulls with new professional images provided by the user.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. The previously identified issue of a hardcoded WhatsApp URL was resolved in this session.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Mismatched or incorrectly assigned images (especially for pedigrees).
-   **Recurrence count**: This was a major recurring issue throughout the session, happening at least 4-5 times. The user would provide images, and the agent would misinterpret which image belonged to which bull, leading to significant rework.
-   **Status**: RESOLVED (for now). The final state has the correct images assigned.
    **Note**: The next agent must be extremely cautious when handling image uploads. **Always verify the content of an image file before assigning it to a bull.** The user often provides files with names that do not match their content, or uploads them in a confusing order. Use  to confirm pedigree details in an image before editing the code.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Framework**: Next.js 16 with App Router
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **Data Management**: Evolving from a single monolithic component () to a more scalable pattern where data is separated into dedicated  files (e.g., ) and rendered by reusable components (). The application remains fully static with no database.

**key DB schema**
-   N/A. No database is used.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : **Critical data file** holding all information for the 14 GYR bulls.
-   : **Critical view component** that renders the detail page for GYR bulls, including the thumbnail gallery logic.
-   : The main page for the GYR category, containing the 3-column grid layout.
-   : The special, one-off design for the EDANK bull.
-   : For environment-specific variables.
-   : Contains all images.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The data for non-GYR breeds (Holstein, Jersey, etc.) is still hardcoded inside . This component should be deprecated. The successful refactoring pattern used for the GYR category should be applied to these remaining breeds to improve maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Data Architecture**: For any new category (like the pending GIROLANDO 3/4 request), follow the new, refactored pattern: create a  file for data and a  component for rendering. Do not add more data to the old .
-   **Image Handling is High-Risk**: This was the biggest source of errors and rework. Before using any user-provided image, verify its content. User-provided filenames are not reliable. For pedigrees, use  to read the names on the chart and ensure it matches the correct bull.
-   **Thumbnail Gallery**: The user's preferred way to show a bull's pedigree is now as a second image in a thumbnail gallery on the detail page, not as a separate section. This logic is implemented in .
